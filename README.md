# CookMe

A recipe website that offers personalized recipe suggestions based on users' available ingredients
- CSC 337 Final Project (Fall 2023)
- Authors: Justin Adams, Chia-Lin Ko, and Creed Leichtle

## Overview

It is a recipe site that filters by items the user already has on hand. It will have a few pages basically a recipes library that the user can browse or filter by their own preferences.  It will also offer users an account so they can save their favorite recipes and keep an updated pantry without having to input what they own each time. 

The main goals of this page are to take from the user a set of ingredients and return a list of possible dishes they can make without the need to make a trip to the store. We want to be able to store all the recipes in a well-organized database and filter by user requests.

## Features
- Able to input what you have at home 
- Able to return a list of matching recipes as well as recipes with 1 or 2 ingredients missing. 
- Able to read the recipe files and save them into the database to be searched for
